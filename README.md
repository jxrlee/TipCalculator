TipCalculator
=============

A simple tip calculator. More improvements on the way!
Currently you can
- calculate 10%, 15%, 20% tip
- calculate the total bill with tip added
- split tip amount and total bill between up to 9 people

Future Improvements
- set your own tip %s based on service satisfaction: poor, fair, good, very good, excellent
- superscript $ symbol
- settings screen for customizing tip %s and setting split range
- animations/transitions for changing numbers
